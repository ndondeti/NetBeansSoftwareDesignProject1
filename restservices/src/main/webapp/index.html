    <h3>Software Design Assignment - 1</h3>
    <h3>Author - Vivek Narsimha Dondeti</h3>

<p>Both the server and Client are Maven Projects. 
The server is built using NetBeans and can be run on the glassfish server that comes along with NetBeans.
The server endpoints are <br>
1) http://localhost/restservices/rest/AddFoodItem<br>
2) http://localhost/restservices/rest/GetFoodItem<br></p>

<p>Instructions for running the project.<br>
    1) The server has to be started first on the glassfish server.<br>
    This can be done directly from NetBeans by right clicking on the restservice project.<br>
    2) The client can be run as a java application. The main method is in the class App.java.</p>

<p>The client has a series of test cases. They make requests to the server and print the xml recieved from the server on the console.<br>
    The following are the test cases run by the client.<br>
1) Get a FoodItem that exists in the FoodItems.xml file.<br>
2) Adding a new FoodItem<br>
3) Getting the FoodItem previously added.<br>
4) Trying to add the same FoodItem again.<br>
5) Trying to get a FoodItem that does not exist.<br>
6) Trying to add an invalid FoodItem.</p>
