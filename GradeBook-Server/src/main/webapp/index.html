<p>The client, server and the models are all Maven project. The CRUD-GradeBook-vdondeti-NetBeans is the parent project(POM project)
The server is built using NetBeans and can be run on the glassfish server that comes along with NetBeans.
The server endpoints are <br>
1) http://localhost/GradeBook-Server/CSE564/Gradebook/student<br>
2) http://localhost/GradeBook-Server/CSE564/Gradebook/addClassPlan<br>
3) http://localhost/GradeBook-Server/CSE564/Gradebook/grade/{studentName}/{workItemName}<br><br>
The first endpoint supports GET and POST, the second supports only POST and the third one supports GET, PUT, POST, DELETE</p>


<p>Instructions for running the project.<br>
    
    1) Build the CRUD-GradeBook-vdondeti-NetBeans parent project. This will build all the other projects
    1) The server has to be started first on the glassfish server.<br>
    This can be done directly from NetBeans by right clicking on the restservice project.<br>
    2) The client can be run as a java application. The main method is in the class App.java.</p>

<p>The client has a series of test cases. They make requests to the server and print the xml recieved from the server on the console.<br>
    The following are the test cases run by the client.<br>
1) Get a FoodItem that exists in the FoodItems.xml file.<br>
2) Adding a new FoodItem<br>
3) Getting the FoodItem previously added.<br>
4) Trying to add the same FoodItem again.<br>
5) Trying to get a FoodItem that does not exist.<br>
6) Trying to add an invalid FoodItem.</p>
